# Temp personal website project

A temporary personal website for me to share with others and gather some comments on the design before I decide how I want it to be before building it

Final update: I have finally built a permanent personal website, so this interim website -- which was made for my Front End Development assignment in my Singapore Poly years -- is no longer needed and will be archived.
