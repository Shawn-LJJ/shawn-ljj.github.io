                        I am a year 1 Singapore Polytechnic student pursuing Diploma in Applied AI and Analytics (DAAA).
                        I am pursuing this course because I believe the job demand for it will rise and I have an interest in creating AI and automation application.
                        I enjoy cracking my head and stimulating my mind with puzzles and challenges, which includes coding.
                        Since coding is one of my favourite activities, I thought it will makes sense for me to study and work in the field of IT as job demands in IT has rose.
                        And I like AI and automation, so I would naturally pursue this course of study.
                        I would therefore choose a career that best suit my need to solve problems and create computer code.

                    My personal values may not conform with one another as they may appear contradicting. 
                    I value minimalism, truth, honesty, and ironically, hedonism. When one values truth and honesty,
                    he may have to face challenges within his mind to be fully determined to take on mentally challenging tasks such as solidifying one's point view and intellectual debates.
                    It may be an easy feat for those who regularly enjoys stimulating their minds with new ideas and discerning them.
                    It contradicts with the idea of hedonism whereby one simply seeks pleasure in life and minimise as much pain, difficulty, and challenges as possible.
                    When one values hedonism, he gave up his willingness to become an intellect and seek truth and understanding.
                    It also contradicts my desire to stimulate my mind with problems.

                    I may not really enjoy talking to people, but it mainly depends on the topic at hand. If is something that I can learn from or any deep thoughts,
                    I can have an engaging discussion. I do have a strong tendency to overthink, looking pass the surface and simple things, and analyse things.
                    I would normally prefer making decision based on rational choices, but simple things can be decided based on how I feel. I would also normally
                    do things near deadlines and would rather have a mixed work and play schedule. I often do not make plans, I do whatever I feel like doing.

                    Based on the things I valued, I enjoy learning and understanding the universe as a whole, therefore I have an interest in Astronomy.
                    I also enjoy playing computer games and watch video as my "hedonistic activities". I like to sometimes sit down and do nothing to contemplate
                    about anything. I like solving problems too, so I would like maths, physics, as well as programming.
